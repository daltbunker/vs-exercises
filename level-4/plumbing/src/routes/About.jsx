            The Plumbing Guys was established by master plumber Brandon Taylor in July 2015. It is his great sense of
            independence that lead Brandon to create his own business. He wanted to serve customers in a way that he saw fit.
            “We have a no gimmicks, no-nonsense approach when it comes to the job, we’ve built our company with low pricing, and
            exceptional work.” – Brandon Taylor. It is because of this approach that The Plumbing Guys is sure to be
            a household name within a short amount of time.
